NoSQL-PL2SQL-Simple version 0.01
================================

NoSQL::PL2SQL is an object oriented interface to access data:

  ## Instantiate a data definition (includes a data source)
  my $datadef = new myDataDefinition ;

  ## provided the data definition includes "contactemail"
  my $user = $datadef->contactemail('jim@tqis.com')->record ;

  ## prints something like "myDataDefinition=HASH(0x0000000)"
  print $user ;

  ## prints the equivalent of "Jim Schueler"
  print join ' ', @$user{ qw( firstname lastname ) } ;

  ## prints the equivalent of "TQISJIM"
  print $user->{cpanid} ;

  ## modify and save the record
  $user->{contactemail} = 'jschueler@tqis.com' ;
  $user->save ;

This example illustrates the simplicity of the API required to manage
data.

NoSQL::PL2SQL::Simple provides a shrinkwrapped version of NoSQL::PL2SQL.
There are only a few setup requirements:
  1.  Define a data source (DSN)
  2.  Create a data definition

The data source is an implementation of NoSQL::PL2SQL::DBI.  The best 
approach is to wrap the data source (dsn) in an abstract data source
subclass, which is described in the documentation.

The data definition is essentially a list of the object record 
properties.  The data definition only consists of properties that will
be queried.  Essentially the same as an RDB table index.


NoSQL::PL2SQL::Simple requires a second DSN (RDB table) in addition to the
one used to store object data.  However, both tables can be applied to 
multiple data definition classes.  With NoSQL::PL2SQL::Simple, It is 
possible to build a fully normalized data set using only two tables.

Some of the features and optimizations of NoSQL::PL2SQL have been
sacrificed in this implementation.  For example, when a record is saved, 
the entire record is rewritten.  As a result, NoSQL::PL2SQL::Simple is 
better suited for smaller objects that are infrequently modified.
